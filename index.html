            Hello there it's<b> Alaa Abu Issa</b> talk here ..
            First of all , I'd like to introduce myself and tell you in brief about me..
            I'm Alaa 25 years old from this disappointed country , I graduated from al <b>Yarmouk university</b> with a <b>civil engineering</b> bachelor degree.
            About my experience, i gained a lot of experience in my field especially when i worked at the <b>Royal Scientific Society</b> as a structural spatialist for eight months.
            then i was worked as a site engineer for around tow years at <b>contracting company</b>
            Also i worked as a <b>Robots coach</b> at <b>STEAM Center</b> which is the main reason why i'm here now in this another faraway field from my major ..
            so i decided to shift my career path and pray to be a professional <b>full stack developer</b> inshallah
        </p>
