### New Feature
### I added new type of questions to the guessing game.

~~~
In this webPage you will find a simple Guessing Game. with a 7 questions :
so you will guess an answer for the whole questions about me !!

the first one was about my tall !
and the second one about my favorite food !
the third one about my best actor !
the 4th one about my favorite city !
the 5th one about my best major !

then i made the questions look hard for you , so i added a tow questions to choose with more than two choices not just with yes or no Q !

### I added a functions to allow you to define a block of code, give it a name and then execute it as many times as you want,become easy to read and handle


### Comments:

**How did this go, overall?**
it was really amaizing

**What observations or questions do you have about what you’ve learned so far?**
just about how can i be faster in thinking at "functions" when i solve a users story 

**How long did it take you to complete this assignment? And, before you started, how long did you think it would take you to complete this assignment?**
ummm... not more time to that one who is still beginner
