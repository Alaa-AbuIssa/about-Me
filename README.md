In this webPage you will find a simple Guessing Game. with a 7 questions :
so you will guess an answer for the whole questions about me !!

the first one was about my tall !
and the second one about my favorite food !
the third one about my best actor !
the 4th one about my favorite city !
the 5th one about my best major !
